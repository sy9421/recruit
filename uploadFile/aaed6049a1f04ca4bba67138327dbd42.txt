sometimes i lay 
under the moon
and thank God I'm breathing
then i pray
don't take me soon
cause i'm here for a reason
sometimes in my tears i drown
but I never let it get me down
so when negativity surrounds
I know some day it'll all turn around
because
all my live i've been waiting for
i've been praying for
for the poople to say
that we dont wanna fight no more
they'll be no more wars
and our children will play
one day
